#Supermarket Sales Analysis
#Project Overview
This project analyzes supermarket sales data to uncover trends and patterns in customer behavior. The analysis focuses on understanding the preferences of different demographic groups in purchasing products from the supermarket.

#Conclusion
After comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the following insights were revealed:

1)Consumer vs. Corporate vs. Home Office Customers:
From the chart, we observe that the number of consumers is higher compared to corporate and home office customers in the supermarket.
2)Category Comparison - "Office Supplies" vs. "Furniture" vs. "Technology":
The graph indicates that "office supplies" have a higher quantity compared to "furniture" and "technology" items in our supermarket.
3)Sub-Category Quantity - "Binders":
Among the sub-categories, "binders" show the highest quantity compared to other products in our supermarket.
4)Geographical Distribution - "Postal Code" Histogram:
The histogram of "Postal Code" values gives a snapshot of the distribution of customers or sales across different locations.
5)Sales Outliers:
The box plot highlights the presence of numerous outliers in the sales column of our dataset, indicating potential extreme values compared to the rest of the data.

In summary, these visualizations provide valuable insights into the customer demographics, popular categories and products, geographical reach, and presence of outliers in sales data within our supermarket dataset.

#Data Cleaning and EDA
The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in the dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the distribution of variables, relationships between features, and identification of trends.

#Future Improvements
Future iterations of this analysis could include:
